===============================

Compile:
--------
$ make

Execute:
--------
$ ./modularityGraphs [-n <nodes>] [-m <edges>] [-c <communities>] [-Q <modularity>] [-s <seed>]

## Default values:
## nodes = 1000
## edges = 4000;
## communities = 10;
## modularity = 0.8;
## seed = 0;

## Restrictions in the parameter values:+
## 1. c must be greater than 1
## 2. Q must be in the interval (0,1)
